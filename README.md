![Demonstration](./static/Gif.gif)

This is the project where you choose any topic you want to learn on coursera and the scripts will make you an excel file with the following columns: Course Name, Course Provider, Course Description, number of students enrolled, and number of ratings. And you will be redirected to the page where you will be given a link to the file so that you can view it or download it.
